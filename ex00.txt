General idea:
How to get started with a git repository, make commits and pushing.
This is just a reminder for students when they start their cursus.

Content of the exercise:
 - Create a file named 'README.md'
 - Input your login inside of the file.
 - Commit this change, making sure to follow the conventional commit norm
   - This is arbitrary on my end, but I believe it is a good idea to make students learn the basics while respecting this norm.
 - Create a file named 'git.txt'
 - Inside, put the complete hash of the last commit.
 - Again, commit this change, following the conventional commit norm
 - Make sure to push those commits

For the evaluation:
 - Check the files README.md and git.txt exist
 - Check the content of the file README.md is in fact the login of the correctee
 - Check the content of the git.txt, it should be the hash of the commit from the README.md modification
 - Check that all the commits are made by the student
 - Check that all the commits respect the conventional commit norm.
 - Useful commands for the evaluation:
   - git log
   - git status
   - cat
   - ls
