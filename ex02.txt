General idea:
Learn to handle and resolve merge conflicts

Content of the exercise:
 - Re-do the steps from exercise 00.
 - In main, create a file main.c containing your 42 Header and containing the following code (snip.).

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	char *best_of_the_best = "ottomata";
	printf("%s is the best.\n", best_of_the_best);
	return (0);
}
 - In a new branch from main 'feat/main', edit main.c as such:

int main(void)
{
        char *one_of_the_best = "<login>";
        printf("%s is the best.\n", one_of_the_best);
        return (0);
}
 - In main, edit main.c as such:

int main(void)
{
        char *best_of_the_best = "ottomata";
        printf("%s is one of the best.\n", best_of_the_best);
        return (0);
}
 - Merge feat/main into main with a commit. While doing so, copy the content of main.c during the merge conflicts resolution process into a file 'conflicts.txt'
 - Merge fix/best into main with a commit. When resolving the conflict, make sure to combine both changes so it reads one_of_the_best = "<login>" AND printf("%s is one of the best.\n", one_of_the_best);
 - Do not delete any branch.
 - You must do everything by hand, using automated conflicts resolvers will be considered cheating.
