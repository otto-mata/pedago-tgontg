General idea:
Learn the creation of branches, make changes and merge those changes

Content of the exercise:
 - Re-do the steps from exercise 00.
 - Create a branch named 'doc/truth' diverging from main.
 - In this branch, create a file named 'truth.txt', containing the absolute truth '42 is the best school in the world.'
 - Merge this branch into main, creating a commit.
 - Create a new branch named 'fix/truth-doc' diverging from main.
 - In this branch, edit the file 'truth.txt' such as it contains the correct truth '42Paris is the best school in the world.'
 - Merge 'fix/truth-doc' into main using fast-forward merge.
 - Remove the branches that were merged into main. They are not useful anymore.

For the evalutation:
 - Use git branch to check that there only is the 'main' branch.
 - use git log --graph --online to check the merges
 - check that there is a commit for the branch 'doc/truth' but not for 'fix/truth-doc'
 - ask questions about fast forwarding
