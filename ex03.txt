General Idea:
Cleanup commit history with rebase.

Content of the exercise:
 - Re-do the steps from exercise 00.
 - Copy the content of the animals.tar file into your directory.
 - On a new branch named feat/new-cats, modify the file cats.csv so that:
   - It contains 3 new cats
   - Each cat is added with a new commit, respecting the CC norm
 - On main, modify the file dogs.csv so that it contains a new dog
   - This dog is named Herbert
   - Herbert weights 140lbs
   - Herbert is 1 year old
   - Herbert is grey
 - Back on feat/new-cats, rebase onto main interactively, squashing the 3 cat-adding commits.
 - Resolve conflicts, if any. (There should not be any)
